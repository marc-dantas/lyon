## What is Lyon? ü§î
Lyon is a simple interpreted command language made for the purpose of **teaching low-level programming and programming logic to programming beginners** with simple commands that work in the same way as low-level languages like *Assembly* or *C* ("middle-level").

<hr>

## Lyon features for the next versions

- [ ] use the _**dollar** literals_ to variables (like `outln "$var1"` or `outln "The value is $val"`)

- [ ] Implement a more "low-level"-like logic.
